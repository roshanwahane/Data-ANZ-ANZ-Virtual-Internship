## Task 1

### Exploratory Data Analysis
This dataset contains synthesised transactions containing 3 monthsâ€™ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions.
We will begin by performing basic data checks such as checking for any data issues and perform data cleaning as required.
We will then continue with gaining overall insights about the data followed by segmenting the dataset by transaction date and time to perform visualisation about customer transactions over the course of an average week, day, week, etc.
Finally, we will perform data visualisation on the location information provided in the dataset to gain further insights on customer transactions.

## Task 2

### Predict annual salary
Explore correlations between annual salary and various customer attributes. Some of the attributes are already available but we will work on deriving more attributes from the dataset.
We will further calculate and visualise correlation between different attributes in the dataset.
Once we have the dataset ready, we will begin to build a linear regression model followed by decision-based regression tree to predict annual salary of customers in the dataset.
We will conclude the project by comparing the performance of two models.
